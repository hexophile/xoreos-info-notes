Welcome to small introduction to xoreos project tree.


1.1. Xoreos tree.

	src/common/ is common code, like streams, maths stuff, unicode
strings, etc.

	src/aurora/ is BioWare specific things, like loaders for general file
formats (GFF, RIM, ERF, ...) or manager classes for low-level BioWare things,
like a ResourceManager, TalkManager (for localized string resources)

	src/aurora/nwscript/ is the general loader and interpreter for the
NWScript, the BioWare script language. Not including game-specific functions,
and the like src/events/ is input stuff, like keyboard, mouse, gamepad, timers
etc.

	src/graphics/ is everything involving graphics.
Subdirectories for specific graphics things, like image decoders, shaders, and
BioWare-related graphics loaders in src/graphics/aurora/

	src/sound/ is the sound subsystem. Everything needed to play sound and
music. src/sound/decoder/ has specific sound file format decoders, such as
MP3, AAC, WMA, ...

	src/video/ is for video files, i.e. cutscenes. Bink, QuickTime, XMV

	src/engines/ is game specific code src/engines/aurora/ contains
utility code used by the game logic of all games and src/engines/{nwn, nwn2,
kotor, kotor2, jade, sonic, witcher, dragonage, dragonage2}/ is game logic for
these specific games

// Going further down...

	src/engines/nwn/script/ has the Neverwinter Nights specific script
functions and src/engines/nwn/gui/ (and subdirectories) are for the graphical
user interface of NWN (i.e. the menus) Similar the GUI in KotOR and Jade, but
those are not as much implemented as the NWN GUI

1.2. Extra.

	There's also a few things outside src/, which is 3rd party code. Like
a: Lua script interpreter (needed for The Witcher), glew (which manages OpenGL
extensions), utf8cpp (utility code for working with UTF-8), etc.


build-aux and m4 is needed for the autotools build system. m4/ contains
scripts looking for libraries we depend on (Boost, SDL2, ...); documented in
BUILDDEP dists/ contains platform specific things, like the icons for the
Windows and Mac OS X binaries doc/ is a directory where a Doxygen
documentation is generated in gitstamp/ is an autotools hack thing that, on
each build, grabs the current git revision, so that the binary contains a
string of the git revision (and build time) as extra version information.



2. Files formats.

	Specific files formats:

.are - Area files, like background music.

.art - Grass, wind, fog, camera properties per room, etc.

.dlg - Conversations files

.erf - All files packed to one. (One file to rule them all)
More information: /xoreos-docs/blob/master/specs/bioware/ERF_Format.pdf

.ifo - Module info file.

.itp - Palette file.

.lyt - file contains specific layout of the different rooms, something like
model files.

.rim - Archive file of .erf

.vis - visibility of rooms ("room to room visibility array (I.e. say, from
room 1, you can see room 2, 5 and 7)" - DrMcCoy).

.gff - This is storage for all other files. (It isn't the .erf file format)
More information: /xoreos-docs/blob/master/specs/bioware/GFF_Format.pdf
